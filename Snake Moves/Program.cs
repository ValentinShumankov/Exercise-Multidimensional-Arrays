//Snake Moves
//You are walking in the park and you encounter a snake! You are terrified,
//and you start running zig-zag, so the snake starts following you. 
//You have a task to visualize the snake’s path in a square form. 
//A snake is represented by a string. 
//The isle is a rectangular matrix of size NxM. 
//A snake starts going down from the top-left corner and slithers its way down. 
//    The first cell is filled with the first symbol of the snake,
//the second cell is filled with the second symbol, etc.
//    The snake is as long as it takes in order to fill the stairs completely – if you reach the end of the string representing the snake,
//    start again at the beginning. After you fill the matrix with the snake’s path, you should print it.
//Input
//The input data should be read from the console. It consists of exactly two lines
//On the first line, you’ll receive the dimensions of the stairs in format: "N M", where N is the number of rows, and M is the number of columns. 
//They’ll be separated by a single space
//On the second line you’ll receive the string representing the snake
//Output
//The output should be printed on the console. It should consist of N lines
//Each line should contain a string representing the respective row of the matrix
//Constraints
//The dimensions N and M of the matrix will be integers in the range [1 … 12]
//The snake will be a string with length in the range [1 … 20] and will not contain any whitespace characters
//Examples

//Input
//5 6
//SoftUni

//Output
//SoftUn
//UtfoSi
//niSoft
//foSinU
//tUniSo
